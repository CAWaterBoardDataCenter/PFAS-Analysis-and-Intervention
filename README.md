# PFAS-Analysis-and-Intervention

Analysis of PFAS contamination level data may be time consuming or the personnel to do the analysis is non-existent. With PFAS awareness and monitoring on the rise the goal of this project is to prepare testing organizations for further regulations, expedite the analysis process, as well as help to proactively implement interventions to prevent further contamination. The anticipated impacts would be to identify possible sources of contamination and stop the spread of PFAS at the source as well as implementing monitoring events.
