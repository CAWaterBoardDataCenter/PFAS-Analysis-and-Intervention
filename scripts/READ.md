### PFA Data Transformation Scrtips
The files in this directory are for extracting and transforming data.

#### Files:
dbftocsv.py - A file that converts dbf files into csvs. To use the Files:
     - insert the dbf into the `dbfiles`` folder 
     - create a new folder (month/year/csv)
     - run `python scrtips/dbftocsv.py` in parent directory
     - it will ask for the newly created folder name
     - if there are no errors, then you should have the csvs in the new folde
     ** Note ** dbf and csv files should not be stored in github, these folders are there      as examples.
